# Boom.Army Marketing, Design and Social Brief

Boom is looking for someone to manage delivery of marketing and comms across all our Social Platforms.

## What is Boom?

Boom is building a Social Network built on the Solana blockchain to enable people to create NFT Communities with one click, govern access to those Communities using NFTs and trade NFTs on our Creator Marketplace.

### Our Vision

1. To be the place for Solana NFT owners to gather and connect around all things NFT
2. To add commerce to Social Content and allow Creators to get paid for the value they produce
3. To remove the middle-man so 100% of Content value goes to the Creators and Hosts engaged in delivering it
4. To enable anyone, regardless of race, creed, or colour to speak freely
5. To build a platform that augments the human communication experience rather than hacks it for commercial gain
6. To decentralise and democratise Social Media on blockchain and make it antifragile

### 1Q22 Delivery

In the quarter of 2022 we&#39;ve got two big features being delivered that need good comms around them:

1. The ability to mint, display and sell NFTs in your gallery
2. Deliver communities, roles and experiences based on the NFTs you hold in your wallet

All the most up to date information can be found in our docs folder on Github at [https://github.com/boom-army/docs](https://github.com/boom-army/docs) .

- Detailed understanding and experience delivering marketing campaigns across multiple social platforms (Twitter, Discord, Boom.Army, etc.)
