lead: "There's a lot going on behind the scenes and we've shifted gears from 2 weeks of promoting our NFT to a new build phase to deliver on the work we've promised. I'm going to be a bit busier day to day on the delivery side of things over the next 8 weeks, so I'll try and be in boom/discord/twitter as much as possible but most of my time will be focused on shipping work. I'm going to write a weekly diary of whats going on to keep everyone up to date and this is the first chapter. "

Here's a list of the core things happening at the moment to keep you in the loop:

- On the back of sales of The 1303 OG, we've hired more developers to deliver NFT Channels and the Market Place
- The design is complete for the Market Place and the NFT Channels (see attached images)
- We're in talks currently with a VC that is interested in buying all remaining 1303 OGs direct from us (OTC)
- We're working on our first generative NFT which is going to serve as the first Season Pass (loads more detail to come on this)
- There's going to be 3 separate Season 1 task based NFTs and we're drafting details around this
- We're looking to hire a marketing/design/social manager to run comms as we do delivery (see attached PDF and let us know if you know of anyone who fits this brief)
