I think this tweet sums up my thoughts on it best - https://twitter.com/harkl_/status/1501824183759605762.

By far and away the biggest news since the last update is we've officially welcomed @Flamulus to the team as our Marketing/Community Manager go to guy. Although he needs no introduction as he's been doing the hard :mahi:  for a long time around these parts with his phenomenal artistic skills. I have to say, it's an absolute pleasure to be able to have someone like him in this roll. It's just simply a huge deal for us, and another big milestone on the journey to Boom.Army delivering Decentralized Social Media on Solana.

## Here's what else we've delivered in the last 7 days:

- All core NFT Action Card characters complete
- First Rare character traits complete for Sadar Wa
- All Boom Heroes Generative NFT characters inked
- Close to 100 different character variations for our Boom Heroes NFT
- Migrated all remaining JS files in our application to TS
- NFT Communities functionality 80% complete
- Improved the post NFT functionality (not deployed)
- Updated the theming with a new font (not deployed)
- Implemented our AI BoomBot tipping algorithm 
- BoomBot paid out over $100 USD in $BMA tokens
