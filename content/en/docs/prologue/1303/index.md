## 1303 Road Map updated (Oct 22)

With the inception of the Boom Ones Auction House on us it's finally time for the 1303 to start receiving their royalties. It's been 6 months since we minted this collection which in the big scheme of things isn't that long, but in Solana it's an age. Being a lone founder is full of trade offs, and the fact that this functionality has been delayed longer than intended has been weighing on me. So it's with great pleasure that I can finally say LFG on the beginning of the Market Place! The end game in all this is to enable all users on Boom to have a permissionless way to sell their NFTs directly from their own Profile. And of course every single sale on platform will generate a small fee of which 13.03% of the profit will go to our OGs - #The1303! 

❤️ to you all.
