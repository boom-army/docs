## Our Vision

- To be the place for Solana NFT owners to gather and connect around all things NFT
- To add commerce to Social Content and allow Creators to get paid for the value they produce
- To remove the middle-man so 100% of Content value goes to the Creators and Hosts engaged in delivering it
- To enable anyone, regardless of race, creed, or colour to speak freely
- To build a platform that augments the human communication experience rather than hacks it for commercial gain
- To decentralize and democratize Social Media on blockchain and make it anti-fragile

## Upcoming features

- The ability to mint, display and sell NFTs in your gallery
- Deliver communities, roles and experiences based on the NFTs you hold in your wallet
- Decentralise and open source our API to enable developers to build Social Media variant apps on top of Boom.Army
- Open access to API data for any individual to programmatically engage with the world's social opinions
- Monetized Rich Content as audio and video
- Unique Promoter Content that incentivizes airdrop campaigns for promotions and engagement

## Tokens

There will be a total of 420 million $BMA tokens with 9 decimal places of divisibility. The smallest unit of $BMA is called a `meep` with 1 billion meeps per $BMA.

### Market cap spread

We've targeted 420M tokens to give a good price range on our journey to a fully diluted market cap up to $1 billion. Of course this will be dependant in the short term on amount in circulation. When we hit mainnet, that figure will be roughly 5M tokens of the total supply.

### Token allocation split

- 30% (126M) Community/Creators/Gamification/Artist Rewards/NFTs
- 15% (63M) Public sales
- 10% (42M) Eco-system & marketing
- 15% (63M) Team
- 20% (84M) Boom Army Liquidity
- 10% (42M) Available for OTC
