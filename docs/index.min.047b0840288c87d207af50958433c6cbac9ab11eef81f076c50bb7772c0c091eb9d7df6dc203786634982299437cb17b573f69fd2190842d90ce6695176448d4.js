We\u0026rsquo;ve got a community of 131 OGs now though, which is the foundation of everything we\u0026rsquo;re about to do from here. In my mind it has been wildly successful to date, because all of the people I\u0026rsquo;ve been chatting to who have bought an OG are absolute ALPHAS. You are our kings and queens, and I want to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re treated like royalty with everything we\u0026rsquo;re about to deliver. The first thing I want to make sure of, is that the NFT you just bought increases in value and utility. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep the 1303 Ultra Rare NFT untouched until a day or so after our Monday Spotlight on MonkeDAO\u0026rsquo;s twitter space to talk about the 1303 NFT project and what our goals are. We\u0026rsquo;re going to keep spreading the word (and our community has been helping hugely with this on Twitter and Discord 🙏 ), but once a single NFT in one of the tiers hasn\u0026rsquo;t sold for 8 hours, I\u0026rsquo;m going to mint the remaining OGs in that tier to a Boom.Army account, and then lock them up. I\u0026rsquo;ll then release the next tier of slightly less rare 1303 OGs, and follow the same process waiting 8 hours. I\u0026rsquo;m predicting we might end up with somewhere between 2-300 individual OGs minted and Boom.Army will hold the remainder of 1303 OG NFTs locked for future use.\nFinal thoughts # This community is going to be legendary. We\u0026rsquo;ll use the locked NFTs we hold to run promotions and campaigns, and I\u0026rsquo;ll set-up a market place where only a few NFTs will be listed at a floor of 10 SOL and 1 Legendary will be listed at 1303 SOL. Once our market place is ready, I\u0026rsquo;ll remove any OGs from ME that are still listed and put them onto Boom\u0026rsquo;s Market Place and ALL our 1303 OG NFT holders will start to see the split share of 20% MP revenue rolling into their wallets.\n"}).add({id:3,href:"/docs/docs/prologue/roadmap/",title:"Roadmap",description:"This document outlines the road map for Boom ($BMA).",content:"Our Vision #  To be the place for Solana NFT owners to gather and connect around all things NFT To add commerce to Social Content and allow Creators to get paid for the value they produce To remove the middle-man so 100% of Content value goes to the Creators and Hosts engaged in delivering it To enable anyone, regardless of race, creed, or colour to speak freely To build a platform that augments the human communication experience rather than hacks it for commercial gain To decentralize and democratize Social Media on blockchain and make it anti-fragile  Upcoming features #  The ability to mint, display and sell NFTs in your gallery Deliver communities, roles and experiences based on the NFTs you hold in your wallet Decentralise and open source our API to enable developers to build Social Media variant apps on top of Boom.Army Open access to API data for any individual to programmatically engage with the world\u0026rsquo;s social opinions Monetized Rich Content as audio and video Unique Promoter Content that incentivizes airdrop campaigns for promotions and engagement  Tokens # There will be a total of 420 million $BMA tokens with 9 decimal places of divisibility.

Please check regularly for updates!\nIntroduction # Social Media has been a primary driver of the Web2 era. Large centralized organizations have grown up on the back of social media platforms, typically offering a free experience for users to share their data with each other. The shared data provided by users is then stored on central servers and monetized by the same organizations, and through this model many of those companies have grown to become some of the largest most profitable companies in the world. The users who provide that data to the organization at no cost, typically have a low opportunity to monetize their content through the platform. This is the environment boom.army has an opportunity to disrupt.\nSolana provides a platform for moving away from a Consumer-to-business (C2B) model, towards a Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) driven social platform. By signing content with public/private keys, Content Creators are able to post and upload content with provable ownership. Through the same mechanism Content Consumers can engage that content for a small fee, and a smart contract sits in between the two parties to facilitate the terms and fees associated with that engagement.\nIt was Melvin E. Conway who stated that \u0026ldquo;Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization\u0026rsquo;s communication structure.\u0026rdquo; By shifting the social media landscape from C2B to C2C and removing third parties from engagement, there is an opportunity to align social media toward a more human centric organizational model. Mirroring real world interaction where peers communicate directly with one another and transact value accordingly is the primary driver of boom.army and it\u0026rsquo;s delivery road-map.\nDesign Principles # The aim of boom.army is to consistently facilitate human centric communication, through decentralization of the entire platform making content creation and consumption a democratic process governed by tokenomics.\nHere are the design principles of boom.army:\n Democratic engagement: The platform should enable every account to post textual content in a self-sovereign manner, without fear of removal, censorship or exorbitant cost in a peer to peer context. Open source: All non-sensitive production code should be open and transparent, available for anyone to audit and improve boom.army. The repository where this code is housed is on github/boom-army. Open data: The long term goal for boom.army is to enable open access to all online data by way of a decentralized API. The onus should be on the user to decide which data is encrypted, and which is public. Speed: Solana specifically provides the ability for a rich online experience with high throughput (65k+ TPS), long term scalability, micro-transactional appropriate fees (\u0026lt; $0.001 USD) and near immediate transaction finality (400 ms). Monetized content: Valuable content should be able to find a real world market value on boom.army, where Consumers are free to operate in a free market to consume that content.  Tokenomics # The boom.army token for engaging with the boom.army program on main-net is boomh1LQnwDnHtKxWTFgxcbdRjPypRSjdwxkAEJkFSH.\nContent Creator to Content Consumer (pull model) # The program should enable Content Creators to attach value to their content on creation. The Content Consumer should be able to view basic post meta-data without making a transaction, but specific interactions should trigger a transaction for encrypted content engagement. This should generate a payment from the Consumer to the Creator with a small portion of the fee being split out for the Content Host. The specific interaction micro-transaction is determined by the platform, but could cover a wide variety of scenarios from emoji reactions to consuming rich media.\n  Content Promoter to Content Consumer (push model) # The program should enable Content Promoters (eg. advertisers) to promote their content within the platform. Consumers should be paid out directly from the content escrow account that lives in the boom.army program. Promoters should be able to attach value to any post on creation, by depositing into the program escrow account, a fixed amount of boom.army tokens to be distributed in discrete amounts limited by any Consumer account address. When a transaction is executed, the tokens associated with the post should be paid out at the specified rate and ratio to the Consumer and Host.\n  Conclusion # This proposal outlines the initial features and intent for delivering decentralized social media on the Solana blockchain. It covers the core design principles of such a platform, and the direction for the project. The tokenomics are designed to benefit Content Creators through Content Consumers, with an incentive for Content Hosts to persist data. This demonstrates the ingress point for moving towards a fully decentralized, democratic, transactional social media platform.\n"}).add({id:5,href:"/docs/docs/prologue/alpha/",title:"Alpha launch",description:"Welcome to the 1303, and thanks for your interest in boom.army",content:"Alpha is live!!! # TLDR; - Head over to app.boom.army and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to login using the wallet specified when you registered.\nNB\n You\u0026rsquo;ll need \u0026ldquo;test-net $SOL\u0026rdquo; to pay the tiny network transaction fees. You can get as much as you need for free here. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have $BMA tokens you will be able to post still, but you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to interact or get reactions on your posts.

Many of the packages we\u0026rsquo;re using in the code base are only partly formed. This is how early you are! Expect features to be generally a bit lack-lustre, and in the odd instance to be broken. If you do find something that isn\u0026rsquo;t working, or have a suggestion, then please jump on boom.army and let @harkl_ know. Alternately, if you\u0026rsquo;re a little bit familiar with github then please do log an issue right in the client repo.\nJust remember Twitter has built their platform over 15 years, while boom.army has been in development for just 4 short months so far. Please go easy on us. As we build up the team, and start getting a road-map together things will get better and better. And because we\u0026rsquo;re monetized from the start, I have no doubt the token will reflect how well the product is doing at each stage.\nTransactions # This is by far the best part of boom.army, and also the part that introduces a brand new social paradigm in the form of Web3. Currently there is a single piece of functionality where this is enabled:\n Emoji reactions: cost for interaction = 0.1 BMA  As we do more development more transactional interactions will appear. But at the moment what we\u0026rsquo;re most interested in is proving the concept.\nThe detail # Here\u0026rsquo;s the skinny on what alpha means exaclty, to serve as a guide and set expectations.\nThe airdrop # We\u0026rsquo;ve dropped 1000 $BMA on Testnet to every person in the Alpha Program. With emoji reactions costing just 0.1 BMA, that will give you 10,000 transactions. But remember you\u0026rsquo;ll be earning BMA from people adding emojis to your posts, so if you\u0026rsquo;re popular your balance will go up. It should create a circular economy, where folks who are providing the most content value build up the most tokens over time. So spread those gmoots around people 👌.\nNB - if you don\u0026rsquo;t have $BMA tokens you will be able to post still, but you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to interact or get reactions on your posts.\nNB - you\u0026rsquo;ll need $SOL on test-net to pay the small transaction fee. You can get as much as you need for free here.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a total of just 420,000,000 $BMA tokens, so that means you own 0.002% of the total supply! If you had the equivalent total supply in $BTC that would equate to about $23.5M USD at it\u0026rsquo;s current price of $62,283.29 USD. That absolutely blows my mind and is obviously not a promise of future value, but it\u0026rsquo;s wild to think about all the same.\nTest Net # Alpha is being run on Solana Testnet. This gives everyone the opportunity to play around as much as possible without any fear of losing real value from their wallet. And it allows us the freedom to make mistakes at this very early stage without too many serious real world consequences.\nBut please be assured, that when it comes time to launch boom.army beta, all accounts will have their tokens transferred over to main-net.\nAlso remember that your wallet address will be the SAME on both Testnet and Mainet.\nPhantom wallet # Phantom wallet is awesome, and it is the only wallet available for use with boom.army currently. This was a technical limitation rather than a conscious decision. More wallets will be coming as our development road map gets going.\nTo view your testnet balance, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to go to your Phantom Wallet Settings by clicking the gear icon in the bottom left and changing your network.\n  Our servers # Our servers are built to scale, with a load balancer and up to 200 t2.micro containers available if we get load. Having said that the guy who set them up is a bit of a DevOps amateur, so there could be a bit of disruption that may need to be ironed out early on. Please be assured that we\u0026rsquo;ll always do our best to provide the best service and be transparent about what\u0026rsquo;s going on. You\u0026rsquo;ll be able to follow all tech support notices via Twitter - @boom_army_.\nAs we\u0026rsquo;ve been very vocal about, the future of boom.army is on the decentralized IPFS network. We currently have the token mechanisms setup to incentivize this in future, but it will be a little while before we get to that stage. Given the primary database client Orbit-DB is also still in Alpha, you can get a picture of how early and new everything is in the crypto space.\nFeedback #  Any issues can bed logged for dev here - github.com/boom-army/boom-client We\u0026rsquo;ll be seeking feedback in a more general format once Alpha is well on it\u0026rsquo;s way You can contact @harkl directly on app.boom.army.

It is integrated with a Solana token and token program, to enable micro-transactions with sub-second finality delivering a Web2 experience on Web3 infrastructure. This specific social format was chosen, because the base functionality of Twitter is succinct and easily understood as a concept for Content Consumers and Creators to learn how micro payments can augment and improve the social experience.\nTokenomics # The core program transaction method between Consumers and Creators is described in the attached image:\n How we built it # Boom.Army was built over 4 months by a single developer. It all started with a conversation in Telegram with a close friend in July 2021:\n\u0026ldquo;The first blockchain network that can build a viable twitter competitor will go 1000x. At the moment I think that it\u0026rsquo;s probably only possible on $sol, $tron and maybe $dot.\u0026rdquo;\nThis idea led to the realization that @harkl_ could build an alpha alone, which started the build process encompassing delivery of an alpha prototype with the following stack:\n React JS client Serum Anchor Contract Dockerized GraphQL API Terraformed AWS server Solana token on mainnet  Challenges we ran into # The technical challenges for the initial delivery of alpha were relatively minor. Learning Rust, and becoming familiar with the Solana program structure were somewhat of a challenge, as the dev community is relatively small. But the passion of the community makes up for the size, and there was excellent support from likes of Chase Barker, Armani Ferrante, and Seb Montgomery. Also, Rust is a language with some of the best documentation and tooling that exists. It\u0026rsquo;s an excellent choice for building something like Solana on top of.\nThe future challenges are likely to grow with each delivery phase. By far the largest challenge on the horizon is decentralizing the database. But there are some promising candidates for this that can be either built on top of or forked and reworked to be fit for purpose. Overall the outlook for decentralized monetized social media is blindingly bright.\nAccomplishments that we\u0026rsquo;re proud of #  Build time: from zero code to full product delivery in just four months with a single developer. Community engagement: As of today there are 1,290 alpha testers keen to jump in and try boom.army\u0026rsquo;s offering of monetized social media. Open Source: All the boom.army code is open source and hosted at github.com/boom-army.  What we learned # Solana specifically provides the ability for a rich online experience with high throughput (65k+ TPS), long term scalability, micro-transactional appropriate fees (\u0026lt; $0.001 USD) and near immediate transaction finality (400 ms). Following Conway\u0026rsquo;s law, development on blockchain lends itself to decentralized patterns, making user account management much more streamlined when handled by a public/private keypair rather than a centralized email system. In an increasingly centralized online world, blockchain is essential for open democratic engagement and monetized social is a key ingress for this paradigm.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next for Boom.Army #  Setting up the company structure (in progress). Launching the token on mainnet. Building out the development team. Taking all code-bases to 80% test coverage. Moving the AWS GraphQL API to a decentralized candidate such as IPFS/OrbitDB.
