In the last moon cycle, I&amp;rsquo;ve been marinating in the midnight oil, wrestling our unruly software beast into something that you, yes, you, my fellow tribesmen and women, can proudly stake your flag on. I&amp;rsquo;m here to pull back the curtain on this madness, give you a glimpse into the bedlam that is my existence as I meticulously chisel, mold, and perfect this digital monolith we&amp;rsquo;re all tethered to which will be ready for your delictable consumption in a few short parsecs.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 26ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 08:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-26/</guid><description>Hello everyone! Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick update of the last weeks dev to give you an idea of how the new DAO direction of Boom is progressing.
Listen to the Twitter spaces for a full breakdown on DAO delivery:
A huge thank you to all who tuned in
Don&amp;#39;t usually do this, but recorded the space because it highlights a pivot for @boom_army_ and I know there&amp;#39;s OGs who will want to hear.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 25ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-25/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 13:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-25/</guid><description>Platform Upgrades for Boom in Preparation for #WhatIsGorgon and Sub-DAOs # Hello everyone! I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share some recent updates to our project that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working diligently on. We&amp;rsquo;ve made significant changes to prepare the backend and client for new code, involving library upgrades and adopting modern best practice approaches.
Codebase Improvements: Huge chunks of the codebase have been upgraded to do with NFTs and Solana on-chain interactions making the whole app up to date and ready for the next round of dev.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 24ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-24/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 13:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-24/</guid><description>The Relaunched Boom GitHub Commit History Unveiled # Over the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work to improve some of the core features and tooling of Boom. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share a behind-the-scenes look into the commit history of the Boom Army GitHub repositories, which offer insight into the various enhancements and fixes I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented.
One of my primary focuses has been streamlining the deployment and building processes ready for the next phase of delivery.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 23ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-23/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2023 13:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-23/</guid><description>What I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to since Jan # Since January, I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping myself busy with various projects and collaborations, contributing to the blockchain and technology space in different ways. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick rundown of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on:
CAW Studios: I had the opportunity to work with CAW Studios for two months, during which I collaborated on several projects and had the pleasure of working with a first class team with huge ambition.</description></item><item><title>A Secure Approach to Storing Private Keys and Transacting in Solana</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/a-secure-approach-to-storing-private-keys-and-transacting-in-solana/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2023 14:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/a-secure-approach-to-storing-private-keys-and-transacting-in-solana/</guid><description>And let me tell you, the crypto game is not for the faint of heart. In this blog post, we will explore a few different ways to ensure that your Solana transactions and storage are as secure as possible, because in this wild west of digital assets, you can&amp;rsquo;t be too careful.
Why Security is important # Let&amp;rsquo;s get one thing straight, cryptocurrency is vulnerable to hacking and other forms of cybercrime.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 22ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-22/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 06:40:56 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-22/</guid><description>Time just absolutely flies in this space. Every time I&amp;rsquo;m back on the keys bashing out a blog post I can barely believe how much has happened in the last couple of weeks and how quickly it&amp;rsquo;s gone.
FUD in full force # Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s been on CT and Boom will have seen discussion around the absolute shit storm of FUD that is currently being hurled around. The FTX collapse kicked it off, and every few days since then there seems to be a new issue for people to wring their hands over.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 21ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-21/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 06:40:56 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-21/</guid><description>Are you still alive anon? Are you still here? I&amp;rsquo;m still here and I&amp;rsquo;m still building Boom. Nothing has changed for the long term thesis on Solana as far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned. It&amp;rsquo;s the fastest production Blockchain Layer 1 at scale, with the best community and developers in crypto period. Boom is committed to continuing delivery indefinitely and will always do so as long as Solana remains the best product in the biz.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 20ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-20/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 06:40:56 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-20/</guid><description>How to unpack a failed launch? Currently launching an auction house on Solana is very much still a case of chewing a bunch of glass. It&amp;rsquo;s time to do a bit of an autopsy on the last weeks #BoomOnes Auction House launch and tell the story for future learnings and to preserve it for posterity. We&amp;rsquo;re living through history folks.
How did we get here? # Back in February, Boom launched an NFT called The 1303 OG.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Ad praesens tempusðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/ad-praesens-tempus/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 07:40:56 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/ad-praesens-tempus/</guid><description>Never a dull week in Solana. With the advent of Aptos, all the ruggers, shillers and grifters jumped ship basically overnight and suddenly there was a beautiful calm across the ecosystem. Many cried out in FUD - the ones who relied on these sorts to pump their bags. But the OGs always realized that those bags had no utility, and the day of reckoning always comes for the ones who lie, cheat and steal.</description></item></channel></rss>
