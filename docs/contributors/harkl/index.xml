You ever wake up in the heart of the desert, the weight of last nightâ€™s choices resting on your shoulders, only to decide you&amp;rsquo;re going to tame the wild software beasts? Well, that&amp;rsquo;s been my trip these past few weeks. Grab a whiskey, light that cigarette, and let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the chaos that unfolded.
The Savage Reality of Digital Landscapes # In the heat of the neon-lit night, several glitches reared their ugly heads:</description></item><item><title>I'm done with twitter</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/im-done-with-twitter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 08:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/im-done-with-twitter/</guid><description>Over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that my reach and voice has got smaller and smaller. It seems like a common story for many too, as I can no longer connect with and keep track of all the Solana peeps that I used to know and love. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we realise how big a point of failure Twitter is for the Solana community as a whole. But it&amp;rsquo;s increasingly hard to keep up with new developments in the Solana space on the Xird App.</description></item><item><title>The road to decentralisation</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/the-road-to-decentralisation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 08:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/the-road-to-decentralisation/</guid><description>Into decentralisation # As you all know one of the long term goals of Boom is to have a decentralized social experience. By far my biggest bugbear with the app currently is that it runs a centralized postgres instance on AWS. Not ideal and not decentralised at all!
With the advent of Threads choosing the open source federated social protocol ActivityPub and the positive reaction from the Solana community around this I feel like decentralised social infra has a clear winner, and now is the time to embrace that specific technology.</description></item></channel></rss>
