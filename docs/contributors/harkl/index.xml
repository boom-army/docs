That means that for every NFT collection you have in your wallet, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be able to select it as a private channel and Meep to other NFT hodlrs in your own exclusive NFT group. We&amp;rsquo;re also making improvements to the &amp;ldquo;Mint your own NFT&amp;rdquo; functionality so that you can create your own collection of NFTs, and then users can join YOUR OWN NFT CHANNEL.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥ Build diary - week 4 ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://boom.army/docs/blog/build-diary-week-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 15:29:20 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://boom.army/docs/blog/build-diary-week-4/</guid><description>I think this tweet sums up my thoughts on it best.
By far and away the biggest news since the last update is we&amp;rsquo;ve officially welcomed @Flamulus to the team as our Marketing/Community Manager go to guy. Although he needs no introduction as he&amp;rsquo;s been doing the hard :mahi: for a long time around these parts with his phenomenal artistic skills. I have to say, it&amp;rsquo;s an absolute pleasure to be able to have someone like him in this roll.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥ Build diary - week 3 ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://boom.army/docs/blog/build-diary-week-3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 15:30:42 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://boom.army/docs/blog/build-diary-week-3/</guid><description>So without further ado here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s been completed in week 3:
