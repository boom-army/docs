By far my biggest bugbear with the app currently is that it runs a centralized postgres instance on AWS. Not ideal and not decentralised at all!
With the advent of Threads choosing the open source federated social protocol ActivityPub and the positive reaction from the Solana community around this I feel like decentralised social infra has a clear winner, and now is the time to embrace that specific technology.</description></item><item><title>I'm done with twitter</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/im-done-with-twitter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2023 08:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/im-done-with-twitter/</guid><description>Over the last few months I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that my reach and voice has got smaller and smaller. It seems like a common story for many too, as I can no longer connect with and keep track of all the Solana peeps that I used to know and love. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we realise how big a point of failure Twitter is for the Solana community as a whole. But it&amp;rsquo;s increasingly hard to keep up with new developments in the Solana space on the Xird App.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 30ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-30/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 08:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-30/</guid><description>So there I was, waiting to commune with the universe. I was about to unleash a series of updates to shake up the Solana DAO space, which will hit the streets like a thunderclap. Get ready to get a whole lot of Juju all in one place, because we&amp;rsquo;re in for one wild ride.
Riding the DAO Messaging Wave # Slap your own face and say Rammalammadingdong, because DAO messaging is about to be released.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 29ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-29/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2023 08:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-29/</guid><description>Greetings, Oddballs and Outcasts,
Brace yourselves for a manic expedition through the pulsating veins of our latest tech concoctions. For those wild-eyed enthusiasts tracking our pursuit of reigning supreme in Solana&amp;rsquo;s DAO terrain, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a gonzo-esque exploration into a week that&amp;rsquo;s been as chaotic as a pack of bats in a strobe-lit cave.
Reimagining Interactions: Tripping Down the Digital Rabbit Hole # We&amp;rsquo;ve been hammering away at our Meeps feature like a crazed sculptor on a caffeine bender, tweaking and fine-tuning until it&amp;rsquo;s as sharp as the hallucinatory visions from last night.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 28ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-28/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 08:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-28/</guid><description>Alright, My Fellow Midnight Coders,
Hope this digital letter finds you all in the best of spirits. Yours truly has been battling the fiercest strain of flu this past week, a condition fit to give an electric shock to a dead horse. So the delivery was a tad slow, like a beat-up jalopy limping up a San Francisco hill, but fear not. We&amp;rsquo;ve still churned out a slew of updates that I&amp;rsquo;m just dying to spill.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 27ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-27/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 08:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-27/</guid><description>A Savage Journey into the Heart of the Code Jungle: The Chronicles of a Renegade Developer # Hello, you savage beasts of the Boom wilderness!
In the last moon cycle, I&amp;rsquo;ve been marinating in the midnight oil, wrestling our unruly software beast into something that you, yes, you, my fellow tribesmen and women, can proudly stake your flag on. I&amp;rsquo;m here to pull back the curtain on this madness, give you a glimpse into the bedlam that is my existence as I meticulously chisel, mold, and perfect this digital monolith we&amp;rsquo;re all tethered to which will be ready for your delictable consumption in a few short parsecs.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 26ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 08:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-26/</guid><description>Hello everyone!

A huge thank you to all who tuned in
Don&amp;#39;t usually do this, but recorded the space because it highlights a pivot for @boom_army_ and I know there&amp;#39;s OGs who will want to hear.</description></item><item><title>ðŸ’¥Build Diary 25ðŸ’¥</title><link>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-25/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 13:12:51 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://docs.boom.army/blog/build-diary-25/</guid><description>Platform Upgrades for Boom in Preparation for #WhatIsGorgon and Sub-DAOs # Hello everyone!
