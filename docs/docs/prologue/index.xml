Introduction # Social Media has been a primary driver of the Web2 era. Large centralized organizations have grown up on the back of social media platforms, typically offering a free experience for users to share their data with each other. The shared data provided by users is then stored on central servers and monetized by the same organizations, and through this model many of those companies have grown to become some of the largest most profitable companies in the world.</description></item><item><title>Alpha launch</title><link>https://boom.army/docs/prologue/alpha/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 12:04:38 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://boom.army/docs/prologue/alpha/</guid><description>Alpha is live!!! # TLDR; - Head over to app.boom.army and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to login using the wallet specified when you registered.
NB
You&amp;rsquo;ll need &amp;ldquo;test-net $SOL&amp;rdquo; to pay the tiny network transaction fees. You can get as much as you need for free here. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have $BMA tokens you will be able to post still, but you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to interact or get reactions on your posts.</description></item><item><title>Ignition</title><link>https://boom.army/docs/prologue/ignition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 12:05:15 +1300</pubDate><guid>https://boom.army/docs/prologue/ignition/</guid><description>Inspiration # Web2 spawned the Social Media craze. Large centralized organizations have grown out of these social media platforms, where users share their data for free. That data is monetized by these companies, and they&amp;rsquo;ve made a boatload of money in the process. The problem for users is that they don&amp;rsquo;t typically see any profit from their valuable data. This is the environment boom.army has an opportunity to disrupt.
Solana allows boom.</description></item></channel></rss>
