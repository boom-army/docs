# Sosol Road Map

This document outlines the road map for sosol ($SSL) - A Monetized, Decentralized, Social Media platform built on the [Solana](http://www.solana.com) network.

## Our Vision

- To decentralize and democratize Social Media on blockchain and make it anti-fragile
- To add commerce to Social Content and allow Creators to get paid for the value they produce
- To remove the middle-man so 100% of Content value goes to the Creators and Hosts engaged in delivering it
- To enable anyone, regardless of race, creed, or colour to speak freely
- To build a platform that augments the human communication experience rather than hacks it for commercial gain

## Upcoming features

- A fully decentralized blockchain based Open API to enable developers to build Social Media variant apps
- Open access to API data for any individual to programitically engage with the world's social opinions
- Monetized Rich Content as audio and video
- NFTs as a source of verified account status
- Rewards for the 1303 Alphas
- Promoter Content that allows advertisers to load Posts with tokens for engagement

## Tokens

There will be a total of 420 million $SSL tokens with 9 decimal places of divisibility. The smallest unit of $SSL is called a `meep` with 1 billion meeps per $SSL.

### Market cap spread

We've targeted 420M tokens to give a good price range on our journey to a 1B dollar market cap. Of course this will be dependant in the short term on amount in circulation. When we hit mainnet, that figure will be roughly 3M-4M tokens.

| Market cap (w/420M)|7,000,000|15,000,000|30,000,000|50,000,000|100,000,000|300,000,000|1,000,000,000|
