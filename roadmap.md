# Sosol Road Map

This document outlines the road map for sosol ($SSL) - A Monetized, Decentralized, Social Media platform built on the [Solana](http://www.solana.com) network.

## Our Vision

- To decentralize and democratize Social Media on blockchain and make it anti-fragile
- To add commerce to Social Content and allow Creators to get paid for the value they produce
- To remove the middle-man so 100% of Content value goes to the Creators and Hosts engaged in delivering it
- To enable anyone, regardless of race, creed, or colour to speak freely
- To build a platform that augments the human communication experience rather than hacks it for commercial gain

## Upcoming features

- A fully decentralized blockchain based Open API to enable developers to build Social Media variant apps
- Open access to API data for any individual to programitically engage with the world's social opinions
- Monetized Rich Content as audio and video
- NFTs as a source of verified account status
- Rewards for the 1303 Alphas
- Promoter Content that allows advertisers to load Posts with tokens for engagement
