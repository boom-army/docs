# Boom.Army Seasons

Boom.Army is going to run time boxed seasons, where users will purchase a generative NFT Season Pass to participate. The Season Pass will come with action cards that are able to be completed to unlock levels.

## Taxonomy

We may find better terms as we go for the language but here is the taxonomy and meaning of the language.

**Season Challenge** - A duration of 4 weeks over which each of the challenges need to be completed

**Season Challenge Pass** - The #BoomHeroes generative NFT that will give you access to the Season Challenge competition. All wallets holding a Season Challenge Pass will have Regular rarity NFT Action Cards airdropped to them.

**NFT Action Card** - a task based NFT card, that can be leveled up (from Regular -> Rare -> Ultra-rare -> Legendary) according to the completness of the Season Challenge tasks.

## Time boxes

The first Season will run for 4 weeks, but eventually we&#39;ll aim to run each Season for a longer duration to allow for longer term campaigns. The target launch date for the Season Challenge 1 is April 2022.

## Season Challenge Passes

The Season Challenge Pass is a #BoomHeroes generative NFT, and will be required to participate in the NFT Action Card tasks. Season Challenge Pass holders will be airdropped all NFT Action Cards the day before the Season Challenge starts. The NFT Action Cards have a task to complete and will transform from Regular -> Rare -> Ultra-rare -> Legendary status depending on the level of task completion.

## NFT Action Cards

There will be 4 NFT action cards in Season Challenge 1. Three of the cards will be included with the Season Pass and the 4th will be able to be purchased as a separate special season card.
