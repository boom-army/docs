# Boom.Army Seasons

Boom.Army is going to run time boxed seasons, where users will purchase a generative NFT Season Pass to participate. The Season Pass will come with action cards that are able to be completed to unlock levels.

## Taxonomy

We may find better terms as we go for the language but here is the taxonomy and meaning of the language.

**Season** - Era, Epoch, Cycle, Age, Generation

**Action Card** - a task based NFT card, that needs to be completed to be realised

## Time boxes

The first Season will run for 4 weeks, but eventually we&#39;ll aim to run each Season for 10 weeks to allow for longer term campaigns. The target date for the first season is the start of April.

## Season Passes

The Season ticket is a generative NFT and will cost 0.5 SOL. You will get 3 extra action card NFTs with your ticket. The 3 action card NFTs have a task to complete and will transform to Gold, silver or bronze status if completed - your NFT will get more valuable with the completed tasks.

## Action Cards

There will be 4 NFT action cards in Season 1. 3 of the cards will be included with the Season Pass and the 4th will be able to be purchased as a separate special season card.

Once the season is complete we will use the database to tally up all the required params for the completion of the card. There will be 3 tiers of completion - gold, silver and bronze. Depending on the criteria the User&#39;s NFT will be updated to the hero card of the corresponding completion.
